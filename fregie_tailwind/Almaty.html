                Almaty Region (Kazakh: Almaty oblysy [ɑɫmɑˈtə ˌwobɫɤˈsə]), 
                formerly known as the Alma-Ata Region until 1993, is a region in Kazakhstan, 
                located in the southeastern part of the country. Its capital, from 1997 to 2022
                 was the city of Taldyqorğan. However, with the new creation of Jetysu Region in 2022, Taldyqorğan was chosen to be its capital, and the capital of Almaty Region was moved to the city of Qonaev.
